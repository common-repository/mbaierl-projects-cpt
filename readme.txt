The Divi "Projects" Custom Post Type - in case you move away from Divi but still want to use the Projects.

== Description ==
In case you ever want to switch from Divi to any other theme you will figure out
that the "projects" custom post type is gone. Instead of using the Divi Builder Plugin,
which still includes all the Divi bloat, you can use this plugin.

It simply restores the custom post type, so you can continue to use your content.

Feel free to style it using Elementor Pro :-)

== Installation ==
Install the plugin like any other plugin, directly from your plugins page but looking it up in the WordPress.org repository, or manually upload it to your server to the /wp-content/plugins/ folder.

Activate the plugin using the "activate" button at the end of install process, or through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.

== Changelog ==
- 0.1 - Initial release
